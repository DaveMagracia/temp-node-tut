npm contains packages/files/dependencies from other developers
these packages are published to be used by other developers 
the packages contains codes/js codes and other useful libraries

NPM is automatically installed when installing Node.js

COMMANDS
npm --version
npm --v
npm -v

local dependency - only use in a particular project (used more often)
command: npm i <packageName> //i is installed

global dependency - use to any project
command: npm install -g <packageName>
sudo install -g <packageName> //asked if installing globally

package.json - manifest file (stores important info about project/package)
3 ways to create this file: 
manual approach (create package.json in the root, create properties etc)
npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
npm init -y (everything default)



----- Why do we need package.json? ----
to provide overall information about the project
